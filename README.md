# figma-select-elements
This is a Figma plugin that allows you to select all elements that have the same name. The use case is to be able to select all elements with the same name to be able to export as uniform files. For example, if you have to select multiple image assets that will be exported in the same format, run this plugin to easily select all needed components/elements. 

To use this plugin, select one element on your Figma artboard. Then, run the plugin to select every element with the same title.
